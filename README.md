## High Concept

You are a spellcaster, exiled from your order, and removed from your ability to cast spells the way a normal spellcaster would. Surviving the brutal exile by your sect, you will venture back to your home to seek vengeance on those that cast you out. Being torn from your past training has left you with an amnesia surrounding the magical arts, however,  you learn you can draw power from these spells by carving them into your very body.

## Features

### `your-choices-matter`
Your Choices Matter: 2D platforming and melee combat enhanced by the playerâ€™s choice in where they apply their runes, permanently changing their abilities.

### `runic-tattoos`
Runic Tattoos: A main focus of player interaction, these runes will allow the player to acquire specialized skills at the cost of being permanently applied to their body.

### a-dark-gothic-horror-aesthetic
A Dark Gothic Horror Aesthetic: A dark and dangerous world trying to stop the player from completing their quest.

## Player Motivation

## Genre

## Design Goals

1. Expansive Levels: Larger levels allowing each player to find their own way to the exit using their choice of movement abilities.
2. Some runes should be like easter eggs only achievable with specific play through choices.
3. Replayability: Multiple combos of runes and attacks will lead to different scenarios in each subsequent playthrough.
4. Player Choice: Players will be able to tailor their skills to their own style of play. Each rune has a different set of abilities depending on where the rune is placed.

## Story

A Broken Land: The Exile is a member of an ancient magical school, taught to control and weave the very energy in their body into forces of elemental and practical magic. However, there are types of magic forbidden from teaching, dark and insidious bargains that control the mind and twist the soul with their use. When the player uncovers their Headmaster dabbling in these very forces they are framed, exiled from their school, and tossed into the Pit. A dangerous punishment brought about in their Headmasterâ€™s most insane ramblings. After surviving the endless fall the player awakens in the sewers below the tower, finding they have awoken upon a pile of bodies of past pupils of their master. From here they will soon find they have been stripped of their magical power but can draw energy from the latent magic in their own body by tattooing the runes of the spells on their skin. They will now need to return to their school, through all of the dark horrors their headmaster has unleashed to clear their name and expose his dark intentions to the world. Their scars are their story and their second chance in this dangerous world as they becomeâ€¦ The Rune Scarred.
